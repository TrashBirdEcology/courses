# Course Description  

Collaborative research (team science) can lead to ideas, products, and information of high quality and impact, yet is a skill rarely formally taught to students. Reproducibility is a key component for effective communication within and outside collaborative research teams. Understanding and applying reproducible research practices benefits the efficiency and effectiveness of the team and its members, and is increasingly relevant as long-distance collaborations are becoming commonplace. Students in this course will learn and apply the basic tenents of reproducible research in a group-setting. This course will use lectures, discussion, and computer laboratory components culminating in a collaborative, data-driven research project. Short lectures and discussions will introduce the topic of and background for each computer-based laboratory meeting, where students will apply the knowledge and skills learned. Basic proficiency in a programming language and a desire to design and conduct a peer-reviewed research project is required. Although we will focus on conducting reproducible research in R and on GitHub, the basic skills learned are transferrable across research tools and domains. 


# Course Objectives 

By the end of this course students will have the skills to lead and participate in collaborative research projects, and produce and share research in a reproducible manner. Specifically, students will be able to:

- Describe the components, benefits, and challenges of collaborative research   
- Describe the components, benefits, and challenges of reproducibile research
- Conduct a scientific research peer review 
- Demonstrate proficiency in creating a reproducible research project 
- Gain first-hand experience in team-based research 
- Plan and conduct research with multiple collaborators 


# Statement on Diversity and Inclusivity

Heterogeneity is valued in natural and social systems. I strive to create a safe and inclusive environment within which we can each learn from and teach one another. It is the diverse experiences of others from which we most benefit. Disciminatory remarks or actions will **not** be tolerated.


## Setup

Before the first week of class,   
<!-- - install Program R and R Studio (required)* [Introduction to RStudio](https://youtu.be/FNrCxTSzq6s)   -->
<!-- - [create GitHub account](https://datadryad.org/password-login) -->
<!-- - [create Dryad account](https://datadryad.org/password-login) -->
<!-- - [create ORCID account](https://datadryad.org/password-login) -->
- [inform instructor of your prior background]()<- this will be a link to a google form to ID baselines for the course
- consider potential data and/or research project ideas for a collaborative research project

# Graded Work
**10% Discussion**  
Students will work in small teams to lead one weekly discussion of a paper, website, or other resource related to the week's topic. Resource(s) should be approved by the instructor by the beginning of the class period of the week prior to their assigned discussion. 

**5% Collaboration Reflections** 
Students will briefly ($\leq 1$ page) reflect upon various stages of the collaborative resaerch project.

**10% Collaborative Project Pre-proposals**  
Groups will collectively propose 2-4 potential projects. Groups can submit a single proposal with prior approval of the instructor. Pre-proposals will be evaluated on originality and quality of their submission.


**20% Collaborative Project Proposals**  
Groups will propose 1-2 potential projects.  will be evaluated on originality and quality of their submitted assignments throughout the course. Assignments include the group proposals and peer review. 

**40% Collaborative Project Writeup**  
The end product of this course will be a manuscript draft resulting from the collaboration of between 2 and 5 students. collaborative project with the goal of report or manuscript submission. Groups will be identified at the end of Week 2, and will collectively write short project proposals for submission in Week XX. The group project will be graded based on the transparency, reproducibility, and overall quality of the computational and written components. *If the group cannot identify/agree upon a project by the deadline, a dataset will be provided by the instructor. Groups are encouraged to seek feedback often and early. 

**10% Group Peer Reviews**  
Students will conduct peer reviews of 1-2 other team projects. The peer reviewers will be evaluated on the quality of their submissions. 

**5% Peer Evaluations**  
Students will provide peer reviews of their team members' involvement in the project. The instructor will provide a final score based on all group memebers' peer evaluations and prior knowledge.
