# About (IN DEVELOPMENT)
This directory comprises materials for a semester-long course on reproducible research. 

This course provides students the basic skills and knowledge required to produce and become ambassadors for reproducible and collaborative research. Knowledge and skills will be facilitated using lectures, discussions, computer laboratory exercises. Students will demonstrate knowledge through homework assignments, reflections, and design and conduct a small project with two or more peers. The hands-on and group activities are designed such that the students are exposed to many aspects of scientific research, collaboration, and reproducibility. In other words, the schedule is designed to allow for ample learning via trial-and-error.

The course is intended for graduate students and, with instructor permission, upper-level undergraduate students. No prior programming is necessary. The desire to learn and practice using open-sourced platforms and software (e.g., Github, Google Drive, Overleaf) is required.
